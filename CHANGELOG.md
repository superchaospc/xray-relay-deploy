# Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- **`scripts/export_links.py`** — turn the relay's `vless://` links and QR codes into
  shareable **PDF / HTML / PNG / Excel** exports. It scans the link file for `vless://`
  lines (ignoring the `=== 名称 ===` / `端口:` / `出口:` decoration), so the remote
  `/root/xray_nodes_info.txt` feeds straight in:
  `ssh <target> 'cat /root/xray_nodes_info.txt' | python3 scripts/export_links.py --out ./exports`.
  Default writes all four formats (per-node QR PNGs, a self-contained HTML gallery, a
  printable PDF, and an XLSX table with embedded QR); each degrades independently if its
  library is missing. Needs `segno reportlab openpyxl pillow`.
- `SKILL.md` — new **Step 4b** documenting the export flow.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- Initial public release. A **Claude Code / Codex skill** that installs and remotely
  operates the [`xray-relay`](https://github.com/superchaospc/xray-relay) one-click
  **VLESS + REALITY** relay script (TCP + XTLS-Vision) on a VPS over SSH, driving its
  16-item interactive menu non-interactively (stdin-feed + EOF contract).
- `SKILL.md` — when to trigger + the install/drive flow.
- `references/menu-actions.md` — exact stdin sequence for every menu item.
- `install.sh` — self-contained cross-tool installer (symlinks the skill into Codex's
  `~/.codex/skills` / `~/.agents/skills`).
- Bilingual (English / 中文) README, MIT LICENSE.

Sibling of [`xray-xhttp-relay-deploy`](https://github.com/superchaospc/xray-xhttp-relay-deploy)
(the XHTTP variant); they share the identical 16-item menu.
